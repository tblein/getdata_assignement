Here is a detailed description of the data that are generated by run_analysis.R
script. The data is a tidy dataset in a long form.

The data are formated in a file with 4 columns (seprated by spaces). The first
line contain the headers.

 - subject: the identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
 - activity: the activity label.
 - feature: the feature measured
 - measure: the effective measurement

The list of feature measured is as follow:

  - fBodyAccJerk-mean()-X
  - fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y
  - fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z
  - fBodyAccMag-mean()
  - fBodyAcc-mean()-X
  - fBodyAcc-mean()-Y
  - fBodyAcc-mean()-Z
  - fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean()
  - fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()
  - fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()
  - fBodyGyro-mean()-X
  - fBodyGyro-mean()-Y
  - fBodyGyro-mean()-Z
  - tBodyAccJerkMag-mean()
  - tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X
  - tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y
  - tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z
  - tBodyAccMag-mean()
  - tBodyAcc-mean()-X
  - tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
  - tBodyAcc-mean()-Z
  - tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()
  - tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-X
